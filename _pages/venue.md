**Accommodation**

Participants are responsible for securing their own accommodation, as the organizers of the Summer School do not have any agreements with specific hotels or specific recommendations to provide.

Green areas surround ETSIT-UPM, and no hotels are within walking distance (all these are more than 30 minutes away on foot). However, ETSIT-UPM can be accessed from these hotels via public transportation. There are direct frequent buses from the first three hotels on the list, and the last two are connected via Metro (2 stops) plus bus (or a 15-minute walk). Additionally, they are conveniently located near a Metro station, making it easy to reach downtown Madrid in just a few stops.
