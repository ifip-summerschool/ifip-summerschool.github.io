#### Rejsekort (Travel Card) 
Rejsekort (Travel Card) is a prepaid card for taking public transportations in Denmark.

You can obtain an **anonymous card** in convenient stores or at Rejsekort machines. We suggest you buy your Rejsekort already at the airport.

When you are hopping on or off a ride (e.g,. Entering or Leaving Metro), please **remember to check yourself in or out accordingly**.
If you forgot to check yourself out, credit in the card will be deducted with the highest fee of the last route you've taken after a day or two. If you forgot to check yourself in and hopping on to a ride, a fine of 750 DKK will be enforced if a ticket inspector reached you.

When checking out, remember to look at how much credit you've left on the card. If the credit on the card is less than 60 DKK, you may find yourself unable to check-in on the next ride.

To recharge your card, go to the Rejeskort machine or a Convenient store.

#### Rejseplanen (Journey Planner)
[Rejseplanen (Journey Planner)](https://rejseplanen.dk/webapp/?language=en_EN) is a service you can reach through web or app, to search the best combination of public transportations from where you are at to where you would like to go, in Denmark. It is also available as app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.rejseplanen) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/rejseplanen/id317007942?l=en).

#### Taxi
You can easily catch a taxi near most train stations. If you're not near a station and need a ride, you'll need to call a local taxi company. Most drivers accept credit cards, but it’s a good idea to check with the driver before starting your trip.
