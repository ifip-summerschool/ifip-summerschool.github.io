<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> What We Assume, What We Miss: Rethinking How We Understand and Design for Privacy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Designing technical solutions that aim to help people make more informed decisions about their privacy might be challenging. To make such tools usable and relevant to individuals, one must understand factors that affect people's behavior. Privacy research in the past has revealed many of these factors, such as privacy concerns, personality characteristics, or previous experiences. However, when designing for privacy, certain assumptions are often made, such as stereotyping or generalizing about the privacy consequences. In this talk, we will discuss how such approaches might be misleading and how modern norm-critical approaches, such as intersectionality, can help gain a deeper understanding of the privacy-related decisions made by various individuals or groups. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Introducing Facial Recognition Technology for Law Enforcement Purposes in Denmark: Parliamentary Support Without Democratic Legitimacy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In 2024, the Danish Parliament gave its support to the police to start using facial recognition technology (FRT) for law enforcement purposes. However, the exact scope and conditions for use remain unknown to the public as the use of FRT has no distinct legal basis but is based on the general competences of the police to investigate criminal activities and process personal data. The keynote explores this interference with the fundamental rights in Art 8 ECHR and Arts 7 and 8 CFREU against the requirements of lawfulness in Art 8(2) ECHR and â€˜strict necessityâ€™ in relation to Art 8 CFREU and discusses more generally the ways in which digital investigative tools are regulated with varying levels of detail and democratic scrutiny. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Navigating AI and Data Privacy: Clarifying the Relationship between the AI Act and GDPR
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union (EU) through risk-based, ex ante horizontal product-safety rules. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems heavily rely on data sets for training, and these data sets are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the extent that they are based on personal data. This interplay between GDPR and the AI Act raises several compliance challenges. This presentation provides an overview of the primary issues pertaining to the relationship between the GDPR and the AI Act. We will delve into matters such as the scope of application, the legal hierarchy, the allocation of responsibility, and the legal foundations of compliance. The overarching concept is that adhering to GDPR compliance may often prove to be the more onerous of the two regulatory frameworks.
