### Call for Papers
A detailed call for papers including possible topics of interest will be added soon.
In the meantime, please have a look at [previous summer schools](./previous_conferences) for initial information.

### About the Summer School
The IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management aims to create a platform for spreading awareness and facilitating interactions and knowledge exchanges around old and new issues by taking a holistic approach to society and technology. We support interdisciplinary research exchange and foster discussions through keynote lectures, tutorials, and workshops. Participants will benefit from presenting their research and receiving meaningful feedback. The IFIP Summer School culminates in the publication of selected papers by the participants as an edited volume published by Springer.

We welcome contributions addressing these issues from any of the following perspectives (and especially the interdisciplinary combination of more than one): sociological, legal, technical, ethical, political, surveillance, intersectional, anthropological, economic, historical, media & communication, regulatory, philosophical, critical, disabilities, and psychological studies in the areas of privacy, data protection, and identity management.

The IFIP Summer School encourages not only interdisciplinarity but also broader diversity. It particularly welcomes submissions on how to foster gender and cultural balance in privacy and identity research and policy, and notably, tutorials and workshops about how to raise awareness in these matters.

#### Submission and Review Process
Abstracts will undergo a lightweight review process before being invited for a presentation at the conference. Full versions of the submissions, incorporating also feedback received during the summer school, will then be comprehensively reviewed after the conference.

Submissions must be made via the Easychair conference management system.

Details on the review process and the submission link can be found [here](/submission).


#### Why should I submit?

Accepted papers will receive thorough discussions during the school and will allow students to publish their papers in the IFIP AICT series by Springer.

All individual members of IFIP member societies (over 40 national IT societies plus ACM and others) plus all members of IFIP Technical Committees and Working Groups are entitled to a discount of at least 10% on all registration fees.

A course certificate for 1,5 ECTS can be granted to students who attend the Summer School and write a short essay on how their research is relevant to or can be inspired by the Summer School sessions. A course certificate for 3 ECTS can be granted to students who attend the Summer School, submit and present an abstract for a research article, and demonstrate that they have addressed the feedback from the Summer School in an extended version or rebuttal.

We encourage submissions from students from emerging economies: applying for support from the IFIP Digital Equity Fund is possible to ease student travel.

### Call for Workshops and Tutorials Proposals

A workshop is an interactive session scheduled for one or two hours and focuses on involving students in discussion. In it, participants jointly work on a topic or project related to the Summer School theme. Workshop activities are summarized in short papers that recapitulate the outcome and the kinds of discussion raised in the Summer School for inclusion in the proceedings. Proposals for workshops should contain a 2-page statement presenting the topic and summarising the planned activity and the expected contributions from the audience members, e.g., responding to a questionnaire or conducting a small experiment. Proposers should indicate whether any special equipment is needed for the workshop, such as audio-visual systems or computational equipment and support.

Tutorials are one or two-hour-long presentations. They should deal with topics that interest the interdisciplinary audience in the Summer School. Tutorials should provide knowledge on theoretical, empirical, methodological, practical, or other aspects relevant to the Summer School. Tutorial Proposals should contain a 2-page summary and state the level and background required for audience members to follow the tutorial.

Workshop and tutorial proposals need to be in English language, and must be submitted electronically; for details see [here](/submission).
