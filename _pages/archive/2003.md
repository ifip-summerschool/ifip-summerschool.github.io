The summer school 2003 is over and was a great success. We would like to thank all participants for there contributions and also for the fun the have brought to Karlstad. Our state aim of bring together eminent research with young researcher was fulfilled. We are convinced that during this summer school a lot of new insights were gained and also new contacts to fellow researchers established.

Comments of participants were: "It was great fun!" or "I had a great time, and I've learned a lot".

# Program
A number of eminent researchers, academics, industrialists and policy makers in the field of risks and challenges of the network society are already in the pipeline to address the summer school and give workshops. The focus of the school will be on dynamic, interactive learning among peers, and the exchange of the state-of-the-art information and views. Each day will consist of keynote talks by two individuals and a series of multi-participant workshops and seminars.

To give you a flavour of the summer school experience, feedback from the first summer school in Brighton, UK included: 'It was the best organised, most inspiring meeting I've attended - and excellent fun to boot'; 'It was very well balanced; 'It works!'; 'It was the best event that I have ever been to and I met some immensely stimulating people'; and 'It was like doing another masters degree all over again, but intensely, in a single week.
