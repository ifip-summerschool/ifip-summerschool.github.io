# Call For Papers
## Privacy and Data Protection in a Rapidly Changing World

The world as we know it is rapidly changing. Established international agreements and alliances unravel. The principles of liberal democracy are questioned by parts of the population in democratic countries. Large corporations accumulate and use vast amounts of data with little or no legal restrictions, and they are gaining significant political influence. Accepted truths about computers and specifically AI become irrelevant in months. How do these developments affect individuals’ privacy and data protection? Which existing principles remain relevant? Which adaptations need to be made? Which new approaches should be developed?

The **20th IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management** aims to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and insights from the multiple disciplines that deal with privacy, data protection, and identity management. We invite papers that present relevant research in computer science, the law, the social sciences, or other relevant fields for presentation at the summer school and possible inclusion in the proceedings that will be published by Springer.

## About the Summer School
The IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management aims to create a platform for spreading awareness and facilitating interactions and knowledge exchanges around old and new issues by taking a holistic approach to society and technology. We support interdisciplinary research exchange and foster discussions through keynote lectures, tutorials, and workshops. Participants will benefit from presenting their research and receiving meaningful feedback. The IFIP Summer School culminates in the publication of selected papers by the participants as an edited volume published by Springer.

We welcome contributions addressing these issues from any of the following perspectives (and especially the interdisciplinary combination of more than one): sociological, legal, technical, ethical, political, surveillance, intersectional, anthropological, economic, historical, media & communication, regulatory, philosophical, critical, disabilities, and psychological studies in the areas of privacy, data protection, and identity management.

The IFIP Summer School encourages not only interdisciplinarity but also broader diversity. It particularly welcomes submissions on how to foster gender and cultural balance in privacy and identity research and policy, and notably, tutorials and workshops about how to raise awareness in these matters.

## Submission and Review Process
Abstracts will undergo a lightweight review process before being invited for a presentation at the conference. Full versions of the submissions, incorporating also feedback received during the summer school, will then be comprehensively reviewed after the conference.

Submissions must be made via the Easychair conference management system.

Details on the review process and the submission link can be found below.

**Paper Submission and Review Process**

The research paper presentations focus on involving students and on encouraging the publication of high-quality, thorough research papers by students and young researchers. To this end, the school will have the following process for submissions:

* Submit an **extended abstract** of at least 2 and at most 4 pages in [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). From these submissions, the PC chairs select papers within the scope of this call for presentation at the Summer School.
* A full length **submission** (up to 16 pages), also in [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), is required to be submitted before the Summer School by applicants whose abstract has been accepted. The full-length paper will be shared with the other participants of the Summer School to prepare for the presentations.
* At the Summer School, each author will give a **presentation** followed by a discussion. 
* After the Summer School, authors are invited to submit to the **proceedings** (again 16 pages LNCS). They are expected to consider the comments and discussions from the Summer School.
* The Programme Committee will **review** these submissions. Based on these reviews, papers might be accepted, conditionally accepted, or rejected.
* Accepted and (after satisfactory revision) conditionally accepted papers will be included in the Summer School’s proceedings, which will be **published** by Springer.

Submissions have to be in English and must be submitted using the following link: *link no longer available*

**Instructions for Workshop/Tutorial Proposals**

* Workshop and tutorial proposals must be up to 2 pages and follow the [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). They must include a description of the topic, the expected participants, the types of activities to be carried out, the expected duration, and what support (facilities, infrastructure, etc.) might be needed from the Summer School.
* The title of the submission must start with "WORKSHOP: " or "TUTORIAL: ", respectively.

Submissions have to be in English and must be submitted using the following link: *link no longer available*


## Possible Topics
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Technical and Organisational Measures, Methods, and Tools for Privacy and Data Protection that address:
    * Transparency and information provision to data subjects: Addressing the entire lifecycle of generative AI systems, from data collection (including unstructured data scraped from the Web) to secondary uses such as improving models from the contents of user prompts. This includes developing tools to detect unlawful use of personal data by generative AI systems.
    * Intervenability and control over personal data: Focusing on mechanisms within generative AI systems, such as machine un-learning, to support deleting personal data from existing models.
    * Unlinkability and anonymization: Ensuring the anonymization of personal data during the training and fine-tuning of models to prevent identification.
    * Confidentiality in generative AI tools: Exploring local training, federated learning, and encrypted processing (e.g., homomorphic encryption) in generative AI systems.
    * Accuracy in AI-generated personal data: Investigating approaches like humility rules, external verification for triangulation, human-on-the-loop (HOTL) feedback mechanisms, and self-improvement protocols that include learning from mistakes.
    * Integrity of generative models: Focusing on preventing, detecting, and correcting model poisoning and data poisoning.
    * Explainability of AI models: Including both external analyses (e.g., probing, counterfactuals) and internal model improvements (e.g., backtracking to identify influential model features, and source provenance in AI responses). This also encompasses detecting and avoiding bias in generated content and decisions.
    * Purpose limitation in data processing: Implementing binding policies to ensure data is used solely for its intended purpose in the context of generative AI.
    * Evaluation and performance assessment: Assessing generative AI solutions’ adherence to privacy goals.
    * Trustworthiness and Privacy by Design: Incorporating trustworthiness and privacy considerations into the development process of generative AI solutions, focusing on system assurance and compliance traceability.
* Law, Regulation and Governance:
    * Data Protection and/or privacy implications of recent political, legal and technological developments (transparency, lawfulness, special categories of data, (joint)controllers, data subjects’ rights, DPIAs, publicly available personal data, explainability, etc).
    * European and other legislation on data and data governance (Data Act, Data Governance Act, Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Artificial Intelligence Act, etc.).
    * The interaction of data protection with liability regulation (product liability reform) and/or AI (AI Act).
    * Socio-legal implications for children, workers, disadvantaged groups, companies, public bodies, governments, society, etc.
    * Governance institutions and policy processes, and regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., national. regional, global).
    * The role of experts and the general public in shaping regulation and governance.
    * Data justice, data fairness and equality.
    * Fundamental rights and accountability in technology and data practices.
    * Certification and standardisation.
    * AI solutions for regulatory compliance, which aid organizations in adhering to privacy regulations.
* Effects and Impacts (negative or positive):
    * Discriminatory effects of technology.
    * Technology-enabled social profiling and social exclusion.
    * Digital divides, digital dividends, data sovereignty.
    * Communities, societies, cultures, and technological mediation.
    * Data practices, AI, and the Global South.
* Socio-Technical Perspectives:
    * Awareness, attitudes, skills, and behavior of citizens and public and private organizations.
    * Approaches for diversity, non-discrimination and democratic enhancement.
    * Surveillance, surveillance pressures, chilling effects.
    * Critical perspectives on data practices.
    * Welfare, solidarity, and care.
    * Data economy and ecosystems, new business models.

## Call for Workshops and Tutorials Proposals

A workshop is an interactive session scheduled for one or two hours and focuses on involving students in discussion. In it, participants jointly work on a topic or project related to the Summer School theme. Workshop activities are summarized in short papers that recapitulate the outcome and the kinds of discussion raised in the Summer School for inclusion in the proceedings. Proposals for workshops should contain a 2-page statement presenting the topic and summarising the planned activity and the expected contributions from the audience members, e.g., responding to a questionnaire or conducting a small experiment. Proposers should indicate whether any special equipment is needed for the workshop, such as audio-visual systems or computational equipment and support.

Tutorials are one or two-hour-long presentations. They should deal with topics that interest the interdisciplinary audience in the Summer School. Tutorials should provide knowledge on theoretical, empirical, methodological, practical, or other aspects relevant to the Summer School. Tutorial Proposals should contain a 2-page summary and state the level and background required for audience members to follow the tutorial.

Workshop and tutorial proposals need to be in English language, and must be submitted electronically.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Privacy as Practice: Perspectives from Users and Developer-Centred Research</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Information disclosure is essential to many digital services, ranging from social networks to critical domains like healthcare and finance. Yet privacy decisions are often based on spurious or incomplete assessments of risk, which often translate into unwanted incidents for end users. This challenge has been addressed from multiple angles, including psychology, information systems, and law. Furthermore, prior work has elaborated extensively on preventative technologies that aim at supporting users’ privacy choices through behavioural interventions or “nudges”. However, much less attention has been paid to privacy decision-making within software development processes. Particularly, to the personal and project-sensitive information exchanged by practitioners as they deploy software-intensive systems, and the associated risks. In this talk, I will share some lessons I have learned while investigating self-disclosure practices in social networks and elaborate on how they can help us shape a research agenda for privacy in software development environments. I will also review the current state of the art on privacy engineering methods and discuss prospective research directions in the area of privacy ‘as code’.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> What We Assume, What We Miss: Rethinking How We Understand and Design for Privacy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Designing technical solutions that aim to help people make more informed decisions about their privacy might be challenging. To make such tools usable and relevant to individuals, one must understand factors that affect people's behavior. Privacy research in the past has revealed many of these factors, such as privacy concerns, personality characteristics, or previous experiences. However, when designing for privacy, certain assumptions are often made, such as stereotyping or generalizing about the privacy consequences. In this talk, we will discuss how such approaches might be misleading and how modern norm-critical approaches, such as intersectionality, can help gain a deeper understanding of the privacy-related decisions made by various individuals or groups. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Introducing Facial Recognition Technology for Law Enforcement Purposes in Denmark: Parliamentary Support Without Democratic Legitimacy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In 2024, the Danish Parliament gave its support to the police to start using facial recognition technology (FRT) for law enforcement purposes. However, the exact scope and conditions for use remain unknown to the public as the use of FRT has no distinct legal basis but is based on the general competences of the police to investigate criminal activities and process personal data. The keynote explores this interference with the fundamental rights in Art 8 ECHR and Arts 7 and 8 CFREU against the requirements of lawfulness in Art 8(2) ECHR and ‘strict necessity’ in relation to Art 8 CFREU and discusses more generally the ways in which digital investigative tools are regulated with varying levels of detail and democratic scrutiny. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Building Bridges in Privacy and Data Protection: A Practitioner’s Tale of Interdisciplinary Work</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> How do lawyers, engineers, security professionals, data scientists, ethicists, business leaders, and clinicians actually work together on privacy and data protection? And what happens when they do not? Drawing on an enduring trajectory at the intersection of law, ethics, compliance, research, and technology, this keynote explores the practical realities of a data protection career across academic, corporate, and healthcare settings. It dives into the human complexity of privacy governance, where disciplinary divides, competing priorities, and communication gaps can hinder progress, but also where genuine collaboration can drive meaningful change. Through lived examples and professional insights, the talk reflects on what it takes to build functional, trusted, and resilient data protection cultures in practice.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Navigating AI and Data Privacy: Clarifying the Relationship between the AI Act and GDPR</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union (EU) through risk-based, ex ante horizontal product-safety rules. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems heavily rely on data sets for training, and these data sets are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the extent that they are based on personal data. This interplay between GDPR and the AI Act raises several compliance challenges. This presentation provides an overview of the primary issues pertaining to the relationship between the GDPR and the AI Act. We will delve into matters such as the scope of application, the legal hierarchy, the allocation of responsibility, and the legal foundations of compliance. The overarching concept is that adhering to GDPR compliance may often prove to be the more onerous of the two regulatory frameworks.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title:</strong> Digitalization & PAPR: Publicly Auditable Privacy Revocation for Anonymous Credentials</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Digitalization is a popular word nowadays, but what is digitalization really, is it just fluff or is it concretely useful? Digitalization can help us to build better systems, technical systems with new properties, but to see how and why, we need to first talk about some basics. An engineering interpretation of digitalization, and how it is changing engineering education at Lund University.
PAPR is a technical system that provides auditability to privacy revocation systems. Simply explained, think of a centralized system in which the system owner holds all user data and can apply mass surveillance at will. With PAPR techniques, we decentralize user data to build a system that cannot be used for mass surveillance without the users knowing about it. That is, if the system is mis-used, we (users) will know about it. This brings a whole different level of (potential) public trust into a proprietary system, letting the users audit the system they are using. A small step towards achieving and maintaining privacy and data protection in a rapidly changing world, aimer at higher objectives in future technical systems. The PAPR paper was published at CT-RSA in 2023.

**Rejsekort (Travel Card)**

Rejsekort (Travel Card) is a prepaid card for taking public transportations in Denmark.

You can obtain an **anonymous card** in convenient stores or at Rejsekort machines. We suggest you buy your Rejsekort already at the airport.

When you are hopping on or off a ride (e.g,. Entering or Leaving Metro), please **remember to check yourself in or out accordingly**.
If you forgot to check yourself out, credit in the card will be deducted with the highest fee of the last route you've taken after a day or two. If you forgot to check yourself in and hopping on to a ride, a fine of 750 DKK will be enforced if a ticket inspector reached you.

When checking out, remember to look at how much credit you've left on the card. If the credit on the card is less than 60 DKK, you may find yourself unable to check-in on the next ride.

To recharge your card, go to the Rejeskort machine or a Convenient store.

**Rejseplanen (Journey Planner)**

[Rejseplanen (Journey Planner)](https://rejseplanen.dk/webapp/?language=en_EN) is a service you can reach through web or app, to search the best combination of public transportations from where you are at to where you would like to go, in Denmark. It is also available as app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.rejseplanen) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/rejseplanen/id317007942?l=en).

**Taxi**

You can easily catch a taxi near most train stations. If you're not near a station and need a ride, you'll need to call a local taxi company. Most drivers accept credit cards, but it’s a good idea to check with the driver before starting your trip.
