# Call for Papers
## Privacy and Identity Management for Life
The Fifth International Summer School organised, jointly by the PrimeLife EU project in cooperation with the IFIP WG 9.2, 9.6/11.7 11.4, 11.6, will be held in Nice, France, 7th – 11th September 2009.

## Background
New Internet developments pose greater and greater privacy dilemmas. In the Information Society, the need for individuals to protect their autonomy and retain control over their personal information is becoming more and more important. Today, information and communication technologies – and the people responsible for making decisions about them, designing, and implementing them – scarcely consider those requirements, thereby potentially putting individuals’ privacy at risk. The increasingly collaborative character of the Internet enables anyone to compose services and contribute and distribute information. It may become hard for individuals to manage and control information that concerns them and particularly how to eliminate outdated or unwanted personal information, thus leaving personal histories exposed permanently. These activities raise substantial new challenges for personal privacy at the technical, social, ethical, regulatory, and legal levels:

- How can privacy in emerging Internet applications such as collaborative scenarios and virtual communities be protected?
- What frameworks and technical tools could be utilised to maintain life-long privacy?

The theme of this Summer School held in September 2009 and co-organised by the PrimeLife EU project and the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) was on privacy and identity management for emerging Internet applications throughout a person’s life.

Both IFIP and PrimeLife take a holistic approach to technology and support interdisciplinary exchange. Participants’ contributions that combine technical, legal, regulatory, socio-economic, ethical, philosophical, or psychological perspectives are especially welcome.

## Content of the School
We were especially inviting contributions from students who are at the stages of preparing either masters’ or doctoral theses qualifications. The school is interactive in character, and is composed of keynote lectures and seminars, tutorials and workshops with PhD student presentations. The principle is to encourage young academic and industry entrants to the privacy and identity management world to share their own ideas and to build up a collegial relationship with others. Students that actively participated, in particular those who presented a paper, can receive a course certificate which awards 3 ECTS at the PhD level. The certificate can certify the topic of the contributed paper to demonstrate its relation or non-relation to the student’s PhD thesis.

Contributions are selected based on an extended abstract review by the Summer School Programme Committee. Accepted short versions of papers are made available to all participants in the Summer School Pre-Proceedings. After the Summer School, authors will have the opportunity to submit their final full papers (which address questions and aspects raised during the Summer School) for publication in the Summer School Proceedings published by Springer. The papers to be included in the Final Proceedings published by Springer will again be reviewed and selected by the Summer School Programme Committee. 

### Topics of Interest
The theme of this Summer School to be held in September 2009 and co-organised by the PrimeLife EU project and the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) will be on privacy and identity management for emerging Internet applications throughout a person’s life.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Privacy and Identity management (application scenarios/use cases, technologies, infrastructures, usability aspects),
- privacy-enhancing technologies,
- anonymity and pseudonymity, 
- transparency-enhancing tools,
- privacy and trust policies,
- privacy-aware web service composition,
- semantic web security and privacy,
- privacy metrics,
- trust management and reputation systems,
- assurance evaluation and control,
- privacy in complex emerging real-life scenarios including the use of privacy-enhancing mechanisms in various application areas that are often life-long in character such as eLearning or eHealth, location-based services,
- life-long privacy challenges and sustainable privacy and identity management,
- privacy issues relating to social networks,
- social network analysis,
- profiling,
- RFID and tracking technologies,
- biometrics,
- surveillance,
- data retention,
- availability and other legal-regulatory aspects,
- socio-economic aspects of privacy and identity management,
- and impact on social exclusion/digital divide/cultural aspects.

### Guidelines for Workshop Presentations
For each workshop paper, we have reserved 30 minutes for presentation plus 15 minutes for discussion. Feedback to the authors should be addressed by them in their final summer school papers to be submitted for the Springer post-summer school proceedings.

After the end of the school, we will as in the previous years produce Post-Summer School proceedings to be published by Springer. We would be delighted to include your workshop papers as well as keynote papers. The entry for paper submission of Post-Summer School proceedings can be found at here. For producing the paper, please use the LNCS templates and style files (available from http:/www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72377-0).

Papers with up to 16 pages should be submitted (sent to here) by the deadlines mentioned above. Editorial review comments will be sent by Mid January 2010. Final papers will have to be sent by 10th February 2010. Proceedings will appear Mid 2010.

### Credit Points
The Summer School can be taken as a PhD course. Students who actively participate, in particular those who present a paper, can receive a course certificate from Karlstad University signed by Prof. Simone Fischer-Hübner as a course responsible which awards 3 ECTS at PhD Level. The certificate can certify the topic of the contributed paper to demonstrate its relation or non-relation to the student’s PhD thesis.

Please contact [Simone Fischer-Hübner](mailto:simone.fischer-huebner@kau.se) for further information.

## Student Grants
There will be some student grants to students from Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Hungary, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine - courtesy to Microsoft Research.

# Venue and Accommodation
## Seminar Hotel
Participants who booked accommodation will have a room reserved at the seminar hotel:

La Maison du Séminaire<br />
29 boulevard Franck Pilatte<br />
06300 NICE<br />
Tel : +33 (0)4 93 89 39 57<br />
Fax : +33 (0)4 93 26 79 99<br />
mds@maison-du-seminaire.com

- Airport:  The Nice airport (aéroport) is located right at the west side of the gulf (Baie des Anges) and it is distant 6 km from the town center.
- Bus Maison du Seminaire: The bus 99 is going from the Airport (every 30 minutes) to the main Train Station (Nice Ville) (Timetable). In front of the Train Station, the bus 30 is going to the Maison du Séminaire (bus stop: La Réserve just after the harbor - Timetable). The bus 98 is going from the Airport (every 30 minutes) to the town center too (every 30 minutes) - (Timetable). The bus 20 and 30 are connecting the city center to la Maison du Séminaire  (bus stop : La Réserve just after the harbor). Here is a link to the timetable and map of Public transport.
- Taxi: The journey between the airport and the 'Maison du Seminaire' should approximately be 30 euros.
- Running: Alternatively you may want to jog to the Maison du Seminaire, it is only 9km and you simply have to follow the sea side toward the east :)
- Car rental: All rental companies (Avis, Hertz, Budget....) are available at the airport, however since the event will mainly take place in Nice (on Monday a bus will be organized from Nice to Sophia Antipolis), it is probably not necessary to rent a car.

## Venue
The venue of the Summer School will be the seminar hotel: La Maison du Séminaire.

The first day (7th September 2009) will however be organised at CICA/Institute Eurecom,

Room Amphitheatre Lumiere,<br />
2229, Route Crêtes,<br />
06560 Sophia Antipolis, France.<br />
Tel: +33 (0)4 93 00 81 00<br />
(Thanks to the support of Eurecom.)

There will be a bus transfer leaving from La Maison du Séminaire to Sophia Antipolis on Monday morning at 9:15.

Other alternative for those who cannot catch the transferring bus: The Bus 230 (Terminal 1 - quai 5 - every 30 minutes) is connecting the Airport to Sophia Antipolis.<br />
NB: to reach the CICA you should ask a 'ticket correspondance' go to "Gare Routiere - Les Messugues" and then take a Shuttle asking to go to CICA (without extra charge - 1 euro)

The remaining days (8th - 11th September 2009) will then be held at La Maison du Séminaire.

## Driving a car in France
WARNING: We strongly recommend to respect scrupulously the road legislation and especially the speed limitation since they are strongly enforced by automated speed traps and the fines start at 68 euros (from +5kmh to +20kmh) and can reach up to 750 euros. 

## Climate
The temperature is usually still warm at the beginning of September (~25 C). However, the evenings can eventually be fresh (in the event of rainstorm).
    
# Best Paper Award
Aleksandra Kuczerawy (KU Leuven) was honored with the Best Student Paper Award (donated by IFIP WG 11.4) for her paper and presentation on "Facebook and its EU users – applicability of the EU data protection law to US based SNS".
