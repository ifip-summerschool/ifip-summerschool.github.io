(Room: [Salón Actos C](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RScQYb4pYSTtePgB6))

**Welcome from the Local Organizers**

**Welcome from the Steering Committee**

*09:20-10:20* **Keynote: Jose Such**

**Human-centred AI Security, Ethics and Privacy.** *This talk will have two main parts: 1) risks in AI systems; 2) AI for online safety. In the first part, I will talk about three risks of using AI: security, privacy, and discrimination. I will show that attacks that can be performed to exploit AI models and attack the systems that use them, that AI-based systems can be privacy-intrusive, and that AI-based systems may have biases that may lead to discriminate against particular types of users (e.g. based on gender/ethnicity). I will then outline our current research and projects on making AI safer. In the second part, I will talk about using AI to help people stay safe online. I will showcase our current research on using AI to study online language, particularly focusing on biased and toxic language and the analysis of echo chambers, and to protect online privacy.*

*15:50-16:50* **Keynote: Isabel Barberá**

**GenAI and the Privacy, Agency and Identity Paradox: Redefining Concepts in the Digital Age** *As Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes our digital landscape, it introduces paradoxes to the worlds of privacy and identity: Can we embrace innovation while avoiding privacy risks? Is GenAI reshaping the way we verify and also perceive our own identities? This keynote will explore how GenAI both empowers and endangers our digital and physical worlds and our understanding of fundamental rights. It will address socio-technical risks as well as the critical role of trust and agency in GenAI systems. The session will challenge traditional data protection paradigms and propose visionary approaches to privacy, agency and identity in the digital age.*

(Room: Salón Actos C, Session Chair: Jose M. Del Alamo)

*17:00-18:40* **Reception at the UPM Telecommunications Engineering School**

After the last session, we will have a small reception at the conference site.

In the evening, you are free to mingle and explore the city.

### Wednesday, Sep 11th, 2024

*09:00-10:00* **Keynote: Gloria González Fuster**

**The future of data and future data laws:** *Who is to access what The European Union (EU) landscape on the regulation of data has evolved dramatically over the last years. Beyond data-centred instruments such as the Data Act (DA) and the Data Governance Act (DGA), there are new rules on data in acts like the AI Act (AIA), the Digital Services Act (DSA) or the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Data is now more present than ever in EU law, paradoxically coinciding with the proliferation of calls for policy-makers to look beyond data, and/or move on more vigorously into the regulation of networks and infrastructure(s). This talk will look into data, as the persistently privileged object of the EU digital rulebook, highlighting the structuring distinction between personal and non-personal data. It will ask how this distinction (and associated notions such as individual/user control) impact the distribution of access to data, and thus potentially to power and justice, and wonder where this is taking us.*

*13:30-14:30* **Keynote: Hanna Schraffenberger**

**Digitalization of society: a value-driven design perspective.** *In this talk, I present past and ongoing projects that address the digitalization of society from a value-driven design perspective. Among other things, I will address issues such as privacy, misinformation, and so-called 'deceptive design,' i.e., user interface designs that manipulate users to take actions that might not be in their interest. The primary focus of the talk will be on digital identity wallets and their potential to address societal problems. For instance, I will discuss projects that use identity wallets for email encryption, authenticated video calling, and digital voting, as well as against fake news. We will look at the potential of identity wallets for privacy-friendly disclosure of data but also discuss potential risks - e.g., services tricking users into revealing more data about themselves than is strictly necessary.*

### Thursday, Sep 12th, 2024

*09:00-10:00* **Keynote: Daniel Slamanig**

**Privacy-Preserving Authentication: Theory vs. Practice** *With the increasing use of online services, the protection of the privacy of users becomes more and more important. Cryptography offers exciting primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs and advanced signature schemes to realize various forms of so-called anonymous credentials. Such primitives allow to provide a high level of privacy protection. While these primitives are well understood in the research community, unfortunately, they lack widespread adoption. In this talk, we will look at what cryptography can do, some deployment examples, and barriers to adoption, latter using the example of the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW).*

**The global politics of identification** *ID is political. Identification used to mean primarily the dialogue between citizens and government for administrative purposes, but today ID systems do much more than this. They create marketing opportunities for industry; they shape access to public services; they act as fields of testing and experimentation for financial and security technologies and their governance; they articulate cooperation between governments worldwide around bordering and migration control; they enable law enforcement cooperation nationally and internationally, and much more. In particular, they create fields where security bodies interact and cooperate with civil authorities. This talk will provide a perspective on how these different functions interact in ID systems worldwide, and the interests that are served by these interactions.*

*09:00-10:00* **Keynote: Teresa Martínez Sánchez**

**The role of data protection authorities** *In an increasingly digital society, where the volume of available data and the technology to exploit it grow at an unprecedented rate, protecting individuals' rights is intrinsically linked to the protection of their personal data. This talk explores the necessity of effective personal data protection as a crucial first step in safeguarding other fundamental rights and freedoms. Real-life examples are employed to highlight the importance of data protection and the role of data protection authorities in both overseeing the enforcement of these rights and promoting the development of technology designed to protect individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms. Achieving this requires innovative technological solutions that can adapt to the constant evolution of these technologies.*
