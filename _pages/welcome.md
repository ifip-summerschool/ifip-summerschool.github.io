## General information

In 2022, the DIGIT Center for Digital Technologies will welcome you to the 17th IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management at [Haus der Wissenschaft](https://www.hausderwissenschaft.org/) in Brunswick. This years topic is **Participation in a digital society**. 

It is our intention to organize the summerschool as an onsite event. Approximate cost for an onsite event will be approximately 500€. There will be a 10% discount for IFIP members. For students from emerging economies, it is possible to apply for support from the IFIP Digital Equity Fund.


## Holistic approach and interdisciplinarity

The IFIP Summer Schools take a holistic approach to society and technology and support interdisciplinary exchange through keynote and plenary lectures, tutorials, workshops, and research paper presentations. In particular, participants’ contributions that combine technical, legal, regulatory, socio-economic, social or societal, political, ethical, anthropological, philosophical, or psychological perspectives are welcome. The interdisciplinary character of the work is fundamental to the School.

## Workshops and scientific papers

The research paper presentations and the workshops have a particular focus on involving students, and on encouraging the publication of high-quality, thorough research papers by students/young researchers. For each paper at least one of the authors needs to enregister to the summerschool.

## Best paper award and Springer

To this end, the School has a three-phase review process for submitted papers. In the first phase submitted papers are reviewed and selected for presentation at the School. After the School, these papers are revised to benefit from the discussion that occurred at the School, and are then reviewed again for inclusion in the School’s proceedings which will be published by Springer.

Every year an award is given for the Best Student Paper. Submissions by senior researchers and participants in European, national, or regional/community research projects are also very welcome, and are generally published in a separate section of the book volume.

## IFIP Digital Equity Fund

PhD and MSc students from developing countries may apply for a travel grant. Grantees will receive a bank deposit after attending the conference if they participate in person in the event. The grant can only be used to cover transportation costs up to a maximum of 500 EUR per person.

To apply for the grant students need to submit their abstract, send an informal request to receive the grant along with an estimation of the travel costs and a CV to _i.schiering &lt;at&gt; ostfalia &lt;dot&gt; de_. Applications will be evaluated in parallel to the submitted abstracts starting from May 22nd. Later applications might still be considered if there are funds left.

Successful applications will be reimbursed after the event and need to provide a signed payment form, a copy of the ticket receipt, a copy of the boarding pass, a report including photographs grantee´s participation on the event, and stating the possible impact it may have.
