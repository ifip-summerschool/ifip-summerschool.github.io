### Paper Submission and Review Process

The research paper presentations focus on involving students and on encouraging the publication of high-quality, thorough research papers by students and young researchers. To this end, the school will have the following process for submissions:

* Submit an **extended abstract** of at least 2 and at most 4 pages in [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). From these submissions, the PC chairs select papers within the scope of this call for presentation at the Summer School.
* A full length **submission** (up to 16 pages), also in [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), is required to be submitted before the Summer School by applicants whose abstract has been accepted. The full-length paper will be shared with the other participants of the Summer School to prepare for the presentations.
* At the Summer School, each author will give a **presentation** followed by a discussion. 
* After the Summer School, authors are invited to submit to the **proceedings** (18 pages LNCS to have sufficient space for changes and updates after discussions). They are expected to consider the comments and discussions from the Summer School. 
  * **NEW 2026:** Submissions for the post-proceedings must appropriately indicate the changes from the pre-proceedings version (e.g., by a cover letter, a diff, color-coding, etc.) to highlight how the feedback during the summer school was addressed. 
* The Programme Committee will **review** these submissions. Based on these reviews, papers might be accepted, conditionally accepted, or rejected.
* Accepted and (after satisfactory revision) conditionally accepted papers will be included in the Summer Schoolâ€™s proceedings, which will be **published** by Springer.

Submissions have to be in English and must be submitted using the following link: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ifipsc2026](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ifipsc2026)

### Instructions for Workshop/Tutorial Proposals

They must include a description of the topic, the expected participants, the types of activities to be carried out, the expected duration, and what support (facilities, infrastructure, etc.) might be needed from the Summer School.
* The title of the submission must start with "WORKSHOP: " or "TUTORIAL: ", respectively.
